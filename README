A simple twitterbot written in Python using tweepy. (Was originally going to use python-twitter, but it lacked built-in Oauth support)

I followed roughly the instructions on this link: http://talkfast.org/2010/05/31/twitter-from-the-command-line-in-python-using-oauth

loginProperties.py
	This is a valid properties file (can be parsed by a Java Properties class).
	Since Python doesn't have an equivalent parser, and since it was simple enough to be valid Python code, I decided to simply use it as a Python file.
	It is imported only by getApi.py

	For security purposes, this file is only valid in the version in my Dropbox folder (~/Dropbox/twitterbot/).

getApi.py
	Uses the login information from loginProperties.py to get an authenticated tweepy API.
	sample usage:
	import getApi
	api = getApi.getApi()
